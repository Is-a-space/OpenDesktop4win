**What's OpenDesktop4Win?**<br>
OpenDesktop4Win is a open source .bat file (and hopefully a application soon!) that when executed will kill Windows Explorer and execute a custom desktop environment to get better preformance.

**How do I run it?**<br>
Simply go to our [Releases](https://github.com/Is-a-space/OpenDesktop4win/releases) and download the latest source code. From there, unzip the file and edit the contents to change where your desktop environment is located. After save the file and run the .bat file.

**Can I make it run on boot?**<br>
Not yet, but we are making this possible soon!
